This file describes the licensing status of various source files in
john-1.7.9-jumbo-7.  It is not directly applicable to later versions.
While many of these source files are now available under more relaxed
terms than they were in 1.7.9-jumbo-7, some have had their licenses
changed to be more restrictive (notably, the sha{256,512}crypt OpenCL
kernels, as per Claudio's preference).

CHANGES-jumbo                   GPLv2; Solar; documentation; new file in jumbo, hereby placed under GPLv2
CHANGES-jumbo.git               unclear; magnum et al.; documentation; git commit messages, might be under GPLv2 since many of the commits were to files available to the committers only under GPLv2, or might be public domain, or might be copyrighted and not licensed (need license then)
CONFIG                          GPLv2; Solar et al.; documentation; additions in jumbo for "include" directive syntax, GPLv2 is implied since jumbo contributors were modifying the file by Solar available to them under GPLv2 only
CONTACT                         GPLv2; Solar; documentation
CREDITS                         GPLv2; Solar; documentation; contains some content beyond contributor names, so might be copyrightable
CREDITS-jumbo                   N/A; Solar, magnum; documentation; contributor name lists only, not subject to copyright (until the file possibly gets other kinds of content added to it)
DYNAMIC                         unclear; JimF; documentation, code; includes configuration samples, which arguably are "code"
DYNAMIC_SCRIPTING               unclear; JimF; documentation, code; includes configuration samples, which arguably are "code"
ENCODINGS                       public domain + cut-down BSD fallback; magnum, JimF; documentation; we should make it clearer whether the notice at the end of ENCODINGS applies to this documentation file itself or/and to the corresponding code (the current interpretation is that it applies to both), and to which specific pieces of code (source files, functions)
EPi.patch.README                unclear; Johannes Gumbel; documentation; contributed for 1.7.2 by the author, so GPLv2 compatibility may be implied

LICENSE.mpi                     N/A; Ryan Lim, John Anderson, AoZ, magnum; documentation; authorship and license statement for MPI support patch, says that the patch is "licensed under the same terms as John the Ripper itself", which implies GPLv2
MARKOV                          unclear; bartavelle; documentation

SIPcrack-LICENSE                N/A; Martin J. Muench; documentation; Martin's copyright statement and 3-clause BSD license
pass_gen.Manifest               public domain + cut-down BSD fallback; JimF, magnum; documentation; we should make it clearer whether the notice at the start of pass_gen.Manifest applies to this documentation file itself or/and to the corresponding code (the current interpretation is that it applies to both)
pdfcrack_README                 GPLv2+; Henning Noren; documentation; GPLv2+ is per pdfcrack license, this file also says that parts of pdfcrack code are "copyright 1995-2006 Glyph & Cog, LLC" and that "PDF data structures, operators, and specification" are copyrighted by Adobe, however "data structures" are probably not subject to copyright, and pdfcrack (and thus JtR) probably does not include the rest
pdfcrack_TODO                   GPLv2+; Henning Noren; documentation; GPLv2+ is per pdfcrack license

pass_gen.pl                     public domain + cut-down BSD fallback; JimF, magnum; code; the copyright notice and license are in doc/pass_gen.Manifest
password.lst                    public domain; Solar; data; hereby placed into the public domain, and additionally it is unclear whether individual lists of words are subject to copyright (they might not be, for lack of creative content), although compilations (such as a collection of multiple word lists) could be copyrighted
radius2john.pl                  cut-down BSD with slight language change; Didier ARENZANA; code; the license adds "as long as the original author is referenced", which is wording not found in BSD license
relbench                        cut-down BSD; Solar, Frank; code
sap2john.pl                     cut-down BSD; sap loverz (author, no copyright), magnum; code; says "Original code believed to be "(c) x7d8 sap loverz, public domain" (as noted in sapB_fmt_plug.c)", then places magnum's derived work (this Perl script) under cut-down BSD license

stats                           unclear; bartavelle; data

Regarding .chr and stats files: it is unclear whether statistics are
subject to copyright (they might not be, for lack of creative content),
although compilations could be copyrighted, and additionally
availability of non-source data files only (not the original passwords,
but only .chr files) might be in conflict with GPLv2.

AFS_fmt.c                       GPLv2; Solar; code
BFEgg_fmt_plug.c                GPL; Sun-Zero; code; the comment says just "the GNU GPL" without clarifying which GPL version (JtR 1.6 had been released without clear indication of license, so a file introduced into the tree in 2002 was not automatically required to be compatible with GPLv2)
BF_fmt.c                        GPLv2; Solar; code
BF_std.c                        GPLv2; Solar; code

DMD5_fmt_plug.c                 unclear; regenrecht, magnum; code; magnum added "No rights reserved" for his changes to the code, but this might not be a sufficiently clear statement, and the copyright status and license of regenrecht's original version is unclear anyway (would have to be compatible with GPLv2 if the file was introduced by the author into JtR 1.7+ tree, but it is currently unclear whether it was originally contributed for pre-1.7 or 1.7+)
DOMINOSEC_fmt_plug.c            unclear; regenrecht; code; no explicit license (same uncertainty as with regenrecht's original for DMD5_fmt_plug.c)
EPI_fmt_plug.c                  unclear; Johannes Gumbel; code; contributed for 1.7.2 by the author, so GPLv2 compatibility may be implied
HDAA_fmt_plug.c                 cut-down BSD; Romain Raboin, magnum; code
IPB2_fmt_plug.c                 unclear; regenrecht; code; no explicit license (same uncertainty as with DOMINOSEC_fmt_plug.c)

KRB4_std.h                      N/A; Dug Song; code; too minor for copyright
KRB4_std_plug.c                 unclear; KTH Kerberos authors?; code; from OpenBSD tree, and in turn from KTH Kerberos tree - we should be able to find the copyright statement and license there
KRB5_fmt_plug.c                 unclear; Dug Song, Nasko Oskov, KTH, MIT; code; Nasko did not include a license for his changes, the licenses for Heimdal project code may probably be found there
KRB5_std.h                      unclear; Dug Song, Nasko Oskov, KTH, MIT; code; same issue as with KRB5_fmt_plug.c
KRB5_std_plug.c                 unclear; Dug Song, Nasko Oskov, KTH, MIT; code; same issue as with KRB5_fmt_plug.c

MD5_fmt.c                       GPLv2; Solar, bartavelle; code; bartavelle's changes in jumbo add SIMD support and extra test vectors, the license is implied to be GPLv2 since the changes were added by the author into 1.7+ (even though sse-intrinsics.c is under cut-down BSD)
MD5_std.c                       GPLv2; Solar; code
MD5_std.h                       GPLv2; Solar, bartavelle; code; bartavelle's changes in jumbo add SIMD support, the license is implied to be GPLv2 since the changes were added by the author into 1.7+ (even though sse-intrinsics.c is under cut-down BSD)
MSCHAPv2_fmt_plug.c             GPLv2; JoMo-Kun, magnum; code; there's a public domain statement by JoMo-Kun, but no statement by magnum, yet the license must be no more restrictive than GPLv2 because both authors directly contributed this code into 1.7+
Makefile                        GPLv2; various; code; there are no copyright-worthy changes left from pre-1.7 contributions by other than Solar, and GPLv2 is implied for post-1.7 contributions made directly by their authors
Makefile.dep                    N/A; none; empty
NETLM_fmt_plug.c                GPLv2; JoMo-Kun, magnum; code; same issue as with MSCHAPv2_fmt_plug.c

NETNTLMv2_fmt_plug.c            GPLv2; JoMo-Kun, magnum; code; same issue as with MSCHAPv2_fmt_plug.c
NETSPLITLM_fmt_plug.c           public domain; DSK, JoMo-Kun, magnum; code; same statement by magnum as in MSCHAPv2_fmt_plug.c, but it is followed by "Code is in public domain" further in the same comment
NS_fmt_plug.c                   public domain; Samuel Monux; code
NT_fmt_plug.c                   public domain + cut-down BSD fallback; Alain, magnum; code
PHPS_fmt_plug.c                 unclear; albert veli, regenrecht; code; contributed in 2007, so must be for 1.7+ and GPLv2 could be implied for that reason, but based on regenrecht's "salted IPB2 mode", which is of unclear licensing status (see IPB2_fmt_plug.c above)
PO_fmt_plug.c                   unclear; David Luyer et al.; code; "This file adapted from other code in this project" with no clarification which other files were used, David's copyright notice is from 2005, which is pre-1.7
SIPdump.c                       3-clause BSD; Martin J. Muench; code; comment refers to doc/SIPcrack-LICENSE
SIPdump.h                       3-clause BSD; Martin J. Muench; code; comment refers to doc/SIPcrack-LICENSE
SKEY_fmt.c                      3-clause BSD; Dug Song; code
SybaseASE_fmt.c                 cut-down BSD; James Nobis, Dhiru, magnum; code; the licensing statement is slightly ambiguous as it relates to Dhiru's and magnum's changes (Dhiru and magnum need to add themselves to the list of copyright holders)
UnicodeData.h                   public domain + cut-down BSD fallback; JimF; compile-time data; "manufactured from" UnicodeData.txt, which was presumably in the public domain (need to double-check), we might want to include the conversion code as a separate script (if we don't do that already), at least to be more obviously GPL-compatibile (must make available the source most appropriate for editing)
XSHA512_fmt.c                   GPLv2; Solar; code; contains minor changes by others (too minor for copyright)
XSHA_fmt_plug.c                 GPLv2; Solar, magnum; code; "Intrinsics support added by magnum 2011"
alghmac.h                       MPL 1.1 or GPLv2+; Netscape; code; dual-licensed

base64.c                        unclear; unclear; code; no copyright nor license statement on the file, it is unclear whether it was contributed by the author or by someone else, and when
base64.h                        N/A; unclear; code; too minor for copyright
batch.c                         GPLv2; Solar; code

best.sh                         GPLv2; Solar; code
bf_tab.h                        N/A; unclear; compile-time data; not subject to copyright since the Blowfish S-boxes contain only digits of Pi
blowfish.c                      public domain?; unclear, Sun-Zero; code; one comments says that "this entire module will remain public domain", but another says "ripped from eggdrop 1.3.28's source files" (were they public domain?) and "Modified by Sun-Zero" (in 2002) without clarifying whether the prior public domain comment applied to the file before or after Sun-Zero's modifications
blowfish.h                      public domain; unclear; code; no explicit statement, but on one hand this is likely part of the public domain code referred to in blowfish.c and on the other data structure definitions are likely not copyrightable
byteorder.h                     GPLv2+; Andrew Tridgell; code
c3_fmt.c                        GPLv2; Solar, magnum; code; magnum added ability to benchmark other than descrypt hashes via this format
calc_stat.c                     GPLv2; bartavelle; code; GPLv2 is implied since the author contributed this for 1.7+, but ideally we need explicit copyright and license statement, and one using cut-down BSD
charset.c                       GPLv2; Solar; code; the changes in jumbo by other authors are very minor (support for building with MSVC, anything else?), so not subject to copyright
charset.h                       GPLv2; Solar; code
opencl_common.c                 GPLv2; unclear; code; was contributed by authors for 1.7+, hence GPLv2 is implied
opencl_common.h                 GPLv2; unclear; code; was contributed by authors for 1.7+, hence GPLv2 is implied
common.c                        GPLv2; Solar; code
common.h                        GPLv2; Solar; code; the only change in jumbo is addition of is_aligned() macro, which is too minor for copyright

mssql05_fmt_plug.c              cut-down BSD or GPLv2?; bartavelle, Mathieu Perrin, magnum; code; the file uses our usual cut-down BSD license, but it also has "Modified by Mathieu Perrin (mathieu at tpfh.org) 09/06" with no license statement for Mathieu's changes (also 09/06 is inconsistent with bartavelle's copyright being 2010 only) - yet since even September 2006 (under worst possible interpretation) is JtR 1.7 days and all contributions were directly by their authors specifically for JtR, this implies no worse than GPLv2
mysqlSHA1_fmt_plug.c            cut-down BSD or GPLv2?; Marti Raudsepp, magnum; code; there's no license specified for Marti, but it's a 2007 contribution, so 1.7+ and GPLv2, magnum's change is "Use of SSE2 intrinsics" and it is under cut-down BSD, possibly not leaving much of the original file left (the file is small)
mysql_fmt_plug.c                GPLv2; Bucsay Balazs, Peter Kasza?, Solar; code; no explicit license and it is unclear if Peter contributed code or merely suggested that "Unbelievable good optimization", but since it's 2008 and contributions specifically for JtR 1.7+, GPLv2 is implied

nsldap_fmt_plug.c               unclear (maybe cut-down BSD); magnum; code; has cut-down BSD license on it, yet is "based on NSLDAP_fmt.c and rawSHA1_fmt.c", which might not (have been) compatible with that - how much is left from there, and who are the authors?
nt2_fmt_plug.c                  cut-down BSD; magnum, bartavelle?; code; has cut-down BSD license on it, yet is "Losely based on rawSHA1, by bartavelle" (how loosely? if not as loosely as to obviously not be subject to bartavelle's copyright, then we'd better add such copyright statement and include bartavelle's work under same license - with permission, of course)

pkzip.h                         N/A; unclear; compile-time data, code; too minor for copyright: the file consists of the CRC-32 table (trivially computed) and data structure definitions, nevertheless it'd be nice to specify its origin, status, license if we could

rar_fmt.c                       cut-down BSD; Dhiru, magnum; code; uses public domain code by Alexander Roshal (lines 240 to 274 from crypt.cpp in unrarsrc-4.0.7)
raw2dyna.c                      unclear; JimF; code; no copyright and license statement, standalone program, hence no implied license
rawMD4_fmt_plug.c               GPLv2; Solar, magnum; code
rawMD5_fmt_plug.c               cut-down BSD or GPLv2?; magnum; code; says "Raw-MD5 (thick) based on Raw-MD4 w/ mmx/sse/intrinsics", but the latter fell under GPLv2 because it was based on Solar's - need to relax license for rawMD4_fmt_plug.c by licensing both Solar's and magnum's changes to it as cut-down BSD
rawSHA0_fmt.c                   cut-down BSD; magnum; code; "Based on Raw-SHA1"
rawSHA1_fmt_plug.c              unclear; bartavelle, magnum; code; bartavelle's copyright statement is from 2004, which might not imply GPLv2, and no explicit license from magnum either
rawSHA1_linkedIn_fmt_plug.c     unclear; bartavelle, magnum, JimF; code; similar to rawSHA1_fmt_plug.c, but JimF's contribution also lacks a license

sse-intrinsics.c                cut-down BSD; bartavelle, JimF, Solar; code; it is unclear from the comment whether JimF's and Solar's changes fall under the cut-down BSD license or are separate - need to add proper copyright statements to before the license
sse-intrinsics.h                cut-down BSD; bartavelle; code; perhaps a mention that the SHA-1 additions are by JimF should be added (if this is true), along with his copyright statement
sse2i_winfix.pl                 cut-down BSD?; magnum, JimF; code; "Based on a script by Jim Fougeron" without specifying the license for that script makes it unclear if magnum's cut-down BSD license truly applies to the entirety of this file

unicode.c                       GPLv2+ and Unicode license; Andrew Tridgell, Jeremy Allison, unspecified others, Unicode, magnum; code; Unicode's freeish license is potentially GPL-incompatible (imposes an extra restriction - requires that their disclaimer be included with each copy - whereas the GPL doesn't permit extra restrictions)
