                        There are at least two ways to execute this attack. The
                        first and most obvious is by using the built-in net.exe
                        binary in Windows (e.g.: net group "Domain Admins"
                        harmj0y /add /domain). See the opsec considerations tab
                        for why this may be a bad idea. The second, and highly
                        recommended method, is by using the
                        Add-DomainGroupMember function in PowerView. This
                        function is superior to using the net.exe binary in
                        several ways. For instance, you can supply alternate
                        credentials, instead of needing to run a process as or
                        logon as the user with the AddMember privilege.
                        Additionally, you have much safer execution options than
                        you do with spawning net.exe (see the opsec tab).

                        To abuse this privilege with PowerView's
                        Add-DomainGroupMember, first import PowerView into your
                        agent session or into a PowerShell instance at the

                        . To do this in conjunction with Add-DomainGroupMember,
                        first create a PSCredential object (these examples comes

                    <p>
                        With full control of the OU, you may add a new ACE on
                        the OU that will inherit down to the objects under that
                        OU. Below are two options depending on how targeted you
                        choose to be in this step:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Generic Descendent Object Takeover</h4>
                    <p>
                        The simplest and most straight forward way to abuse
                        control of the OU is to apply a GenericAll ACE on the OU
                        that will inherit down to all object types. Again, this
                        can be done using PowerView. This time we will use the
                        New-ADObjectAccessControlEntry, which gives us more
                        control over the ACE we add to the OU.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, we need to reference the OU by its ObjectGUID,
                        not its name. The ObjectGUID for the OU {targetName} is:{' '}
                        {targetId}.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, we will fetch the GUID for all objects. This
                        should be '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000':
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            {'$Guids = Get-DomainGUIDMap\n' +
                                "$AllObjectsPropertyGuid = $Guids.GetEnumerator() | ?{$_.value -eq 'All'} | select -ExpandProperty name"}
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Then we will construct our ACE. This command will create
                        an ACE granting the "JKHOLER" user full control of all
                        descendant objects:
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            {
                                "$ACE = New-ADObjectAccessControlEntry -Verbose -PrincipalIdentity 'JKOHLER' -Right GenericAll -AccessControlType Allow -InheritanceType All -InheritedObjectType $AllObjectsPropertyGuid"
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>Finally, we will apply this ACE to our target OU:</p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            {'$OU = Get-DomainOU -Raw (OU GUID)\n' +
                                '$DsEntry = $OU.GetDirectoryEntry()\n' +
                                "$dsEntry.PsBase.Options.SecurityMasks = 'Dacl'\n" +
                                '$dsEntry.PsBase.ObjectSecurity.AddAccessRule($ACE)\n' +
                                '$dsEntry.PsBase.CommitChanges()'}
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Now, the "JKOHLER" user will have full control of all
                        descendent objects of each type.

                    <p>
                        If you want to be more targeted with your approach, it
                        is possible to specify precisely what right you want to
                        apply to precisely which kinds of descendent objects.
                        You could, for example, grant a user
                        "ForceChangePassword" privilege against all user
                        objects, or grant a security group the ability to read
                        every GMSA password under a certain OU. Below is an
                        example taken from PowerView's help text on how to grant
                        the "ITADMIN" user the ability to read the LAPS password
                        from all computer objects in the "Workstations" OU:
