                By default, administrators have several ways to perform remote
                code execution on Windows systems, including via RDP, WMI,
                WinRM, the Service Control Manager, and remote DCOM execution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Further, administrators have several options for impersonating
                other users logged onto the system, including plaintext password
                extraction, token impersonation, and injecting into processes
                running as another user.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, administrators can often disable host-based security
                controls that would otherwise prevent the aforementioned
                techniques.`;
